## Model Weights
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the fine-tuned SmolVLM model weights are not included in this repository.

To run the project:
- Download the base SmolVLM model
- Fine-tune using the provided training scripts and dataset
- Or load locally trained weights by updating the model path in the config file

This approach follows standard open-source practices.
